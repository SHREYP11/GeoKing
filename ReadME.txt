This is CS 2212 Group 39 Game.

Description: Our game is called GEO king and is an interactive geography-based guessing game

Compiling: Should compile with no third party libraries, intelliJ can generate a META-INF, and it is important to select GeoKingApplication as the main if asked.

Running: Make sure to install Java 17 or newer, I have included the installation in the folder with the compiled game, then just run normally.

User Guide: Enter username (none case-sensitive), if you don't have an account when you enter your username, one will be created for you. Click on tutorial this will show you how to play the game. The flag mode and music on/off is in settings. Enjoy our game,
Classic mode is live based, as where frenzy is time-based.

Admin: To Access admin mode simply put your username as admin. As an admin the classic mode becomes the level select menu, and you can track your student in the leaderboard.

NOTE: This game is developed on intelliJ with Java Version 17.0.9 and will need or newer that to run. I have included a installer for java 17 in the compiled folder should you need. There are no third party libraries required to run our game.
